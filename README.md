## How to use this project

This project does a lot of things but its core is searching for tweets and getting daily trending data and storing results in a database or CSV. It uses the command-line to let you store hashtag searches and choose places to watch.

If you want to see how to see how this project does auth, search or streaming, have a look at this module.
