# Minimum number of seconds allowed between each trend Twitter API call,
# in order to prevent hitting API rate limits. (There may be no real
# benefit for waiting like this since tweep's waiting is already set on.)
# If an insert action (including request from the API and adding to the db)
# takes less than N seconds, then our app will wait for the balance
# of seconds. If the action took more then N seconds, we do not need to do
# anything.
# The API restriction for trends is a max of 75 trend calls in a 15 min window,
# which is 5 requests a minute, or 12 seconds allowed between each request.
# Therefore waiting is applied between calls, to reduce the load.
# If the limit is reached, then the app has to wait (this is built
# into tweepy as a configuration).
# Set as zero for no limit applied. Then queries are done quicker
# initially, which is good for a low volume query, but for high volume
# your Twitter token is likely to be rate limited in that window and each
# one after.

# A job will not run if it was run today within the past N hours, since
