Initialization file for tweets library module.

These exist here in lib as some of them are useful as help functions of other
scripts (such as getting available campaigns). However, these could be moved to
utils/reporting/ as individual scripts. And they could be called directly or
with make, to avoid having multiple ways of calling something.
