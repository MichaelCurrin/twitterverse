Streaming module.

Usage:
    $ python -m lib.twitter.streaming --help

This is not directly related to the tweet and trending part of the
Twitterverse package but it has been included anyway. Results are not
guaranteed due to rate limiting not being investigated fully.

This does not need any database setup like the rest of the project does.
You just need your Twitter credentials setup in app.local.conf config file
as per the installation instructions.

The scale of this app is not intended for an environment with
super fast server, database or internet connection, so it may never
be optimal for capturing all stream tweets. But it can be used for
reading a tweet every second or so safely, as a sample of the data.

Even still, this error occurs
    urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError: ('Connection broken:
        IncompleteRead(0 bytes read, 512 more expected)',
            IncompleteRead(0 bytes read, 512 more expected))

http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.4.0/streaming_how_to.html
Using the streaming api has three steps -
    Create a class inheriting from StreamListener
    Using that class create a Stream object
    Connect to the Twitter API using the Stream.

Rate limiting and other concerns

    The Twitter Streaming API has rate limits, and prohibits too many
    connection attempts happening too quickly. It also prevents too many
    connections being made to it using the same authorization keys.
    Thankfully, tweepy takes care of these details for us, and we can
    focus on our program.

    The main thing that we have to be aware of is the queue of tweets
    that weâ€™re processing. If we take too long to process tweets, they
    will start to get queued, and Twitter may disconnect us. This means
    that processing each tweet needs to be extremely fast.
