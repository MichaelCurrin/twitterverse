# Streaming

If you just want to do a live stream of tweets to the console without storing data, then run the `stream.py` utility script. This is not a core part of the project.

You do not need the database setup steps. Just ensure you have your Twitter credentials setup in `app.local.conf`.

```bash
$ cd app
$ # See instructions on how to use an appropriate search query.
$ ./utils/stream.py --help
```
